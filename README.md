# Daniel Playground - React JS To-Do App
An exploration of React JS fundamentals in the context of a To-Do application.


## Frameworks & Libraries
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* React JS Library - https://github.com/facebook/react
* Create-React-App - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
* Jest - unit and snapshot testing


## Scripts
In the project directory, run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready for deployment, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
